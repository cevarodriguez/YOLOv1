# YOLOv1
YOLOv1 algorithm implementation for computer vision purposes using Pytorch.

The algorithm was implemented according to the paper published on the subject complete with its custom loss function.

Results were reasonable taking into account the training limitations associated with training the model on Google Colaboratory.

Feel free to contact me via e-mail should you have any doubts regarding the code.
